    <li>Yizhong Street</li>
    <p>On weekdays, the street’s business hours are synchronized with the high school closing time. At about 5 pm, more people begin to gather. Most of them are high school students rushing for tuition. Therefore, "cheap and large portions" are the characteristics of the street’s diet. On holidays, there are lots of people in the morning and evening, mostly foreign tourists.</p>
